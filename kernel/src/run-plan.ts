/**
 * The run plan: which review dimensions this run intends to cover, in what order,

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The dimension-coverage contract (`dimension-context`) accounts
 * a plan against what was recorded, and it refuses to invent the plan — that is
 * correct for an accountant and useless without a source. Today the plan exists
 * only inside `iterate.config.yaml` on one side and nowhere on the other: the
 * GlassPane harness renders a coverage line from `planned: []`, which reads as
 * "nothing was verified" forever. So the plan gets its own contract, and whoever
 * configures a run writes it while whoever renders it reads it.
 *
 * THE DIRECTION RULE, STATED SO IT DOES NOT ROT: nothing here reads a config file,
 * a session, or an environment variable. This module validates and digests a value
 * somebody else produced. Pulling `iterate.config.yaml` (or a recipe) in here would
 * weld one consumer's file format into the shared layer, which is the dependency
 * direction the kernel exists to forbid.
