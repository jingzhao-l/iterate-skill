/**
 * Canonical JSON serialization — the cross-language form used by the C35
 * dual-binding gate.
 *
 * Rules (identical to `engine/Sources/GlassPaneEngine/CanonicalJSON.swift`,
 * which is the independent Swift implementation; divergence between the two
 * shows up as a fixture mismatch, not as a silently different digest):
 *   - object keys sorted by UTF-16 code unit order;
 *   - no insignificant whitespace;
 *   - numbers in the host's shortest roundtrip form (integral values print
 *     without a fraction on both sides);
 *   - scalars quoted exactly as `JSON.stringify` does (control chars as
 *     `\u00xx`, `/` and non-ASCII left raw).
 *
 * The decision log hashes this form (see `decision-log.ts`), so the digest of
 * an entry is reproducible from TypeScript, Swift, or `printf … | sha256sum`
 * given the same bytes. That property is the point: an audit chain nobody else
 * can recompute is a claim, not evidence.
