/**
 * Transcribing an evidence pack into the decision log's vocabulary.
 *
 * This function deliberately contains **no verification logic of its own**. The
 * three architecture iron laws put "did this change happen because of this
 * operation" inside the Swift engine; the engine already answered that question
 * and wrote it into the pack (`attribution`, `assertion.passed`,
 * `diagnosis.class`, `circuitBreaker.level`). What lives here is only the
 * mapping from those verdicts to the four `DecisionOutcome` values, so that both
 * TypeScript shells log the same words for the same evidence — one of the
 * reasons the mapping is in the kernel instead of in each shell.
 *
 * Order matters, and it is the order of "what actually decides the run":
 *
 *   1. `circuitBreaker.level >= 3`      → `blocked`
 *      The loop was stopped by policy. Whether the interface is fine is not
 *      what this entry is about, and saying `fail` would blame the app for a
 *      harness limit.
 *   2. an assertion present             → `pass` / `fail` from `assertion.passed`
 *      This is the engine's own verdict on the property that was checked.
 *   3. a diagnosis present              → `NO_ANOMALY` = pass, `INCONCLUSIVE` =
 *      inconclusive, any `T*` class = fail
 *   4. neither                          → `inconclusive`
 *      Nothing was asserted and nothing diagnosed: there is no basis to record
 *      a verdict, and an audit log full of unfounded `pass` entries is worse
 *      than an empty one.
 *
 * Then, and only as a downgrade, the pack's own contamination fields are
 * honoured: a `pass` whose attribution is `weak`, or which the engine flagged
 * `contaminated`, is recorded as `inconclusive`. A "pass" the engine itself
 * refuses to attribute to this operation must not be logged as if it had been
 * attributed — that is the failure mode the audit chain exists to catch.
 * Nothing here can upgrade a verdict.
