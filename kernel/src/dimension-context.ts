/**
 * Dimension context: what a run *said* it would review, set against what it
 * actually recorded.
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES IN THE KERNEL. The two shells keep losing the same
 * information in the same two places — a compaction summary that keeps the
 * story and drops which dimensions were covered, and a run report that lists
 * findings without saying which planned dimension had *none*. Both are
 * arithmetic over two lists the caller already holds. Doing it here means both
 * shells report the same numbers for the same run, and it is checkable against
 * a fixture instead of argued about in review.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO LIST OF DIMENSIONS IN HERE. The dimension ids are a
 * *vocabulary*, and the vocabulary is owned by the iterate config
 * (`config/config.schema.json` `$defs.dimension.enum`, kept in lockstep with
 * `config/dimensions.yaml` and the wizard constants by
 * `tests/test_dimension_lock.py` across six sources). A hard-coded copy in this
 * package would be a seventh source that CI does not compare against the other
 * six — the exact failure that lock exists to prevent. So the caller passes the
 * ids it was configured with, and this module only does the accounting. A
 * dimension the engine adds tomorrow works here without a kernel release; a
 * dimension that is *not* in the caller's list is reported as unplanned, not
 * silently accepted.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REFUSES TO DO. It never infers coverage. Coverage is a count of
 * recorded decisions against a planned dimension, and a dimension with no
 * decisions is `unverified` — never "probably fine", never dropped. Ordering is
 * the caller's planned order, and unplanned ids follow sorted, so the same
 * inputs produce the same bytes in any language.

/**
 * Build the dimension context.
 *
 * The rules, stated so a second implementation can be written against this
 * paragraph rather than against the TypeScript:
 *
 *   1. `planned` entries appear in `context.planned` in the caller's order.
 *      Their status is `verified` when `recorded[id].decisions >= 1`, else
 *      `unverified`. `evidence` is the recorded value verbatim, defaulting to
 *      `{ decisions: 0 }` when the id is absent — an absent id and a recorded
 *      zero are the same fact, and both mean `unverified`.
 *   2. An id present in `recorded` but not in `planned` becomes one `unplanned`
 *      entry, status `unplanned`, sorted by id ascending (UTF-16 code unit
 *      order, the same rule `canonicalJson` uses). This is the case that must
 *      not be dropped: the engine checked something the run never declared.
 *   3. `totals.decisions` is the sum over planned entries **plus** unplanned
 *      ones — every recorded decision, counted once. `totals.planned` is the
 *      length of the planned list, so `verified + unverified === planned`
 *      always holds and a caller can assert it.
 *   4. A duplicate id in `planned` throws. Silently keeping the last one would
 *      make the planned count disagree with the list a caller printed, which is
 *      the class of quiet drift this whole structure exists to catch.
