/**
 * The decision log: an append-only JSONL ledger whose entries are linked by
 * `prevEntryHash` — the opID↔decision one-way audit chain that
 * `kernel/schemas/decision-log-entry.schema.json` describes at the entry level.
 *
 * Chain rule, stated so an auditor can recompute it without reading TypeScript:
 *
 *   line i        = canonical JSON of entry i (keys sorted, no whitespace)
 *   sequence      = i (genesis is 0, strictly +1 — no gaps, no reuse)
 *   prevEntryHash = "" for i = 0, otherwise sha256_hex(canonical JSON of entry i-1)
 *
 * Because a line's bytes *are* the canonical form,
 * `printf '%s' "$(sed -n '2p' ledger.jsonl)" | sha256sum` reproduces the
 * `prevEntryHash` that entry 3 must carry. A chain only one language can
 * recompute is a claim, not evidence.
 *
 * The write discipline copies the ledgers this ecosystem already runs
 * (`ApprovalGate.swift`, `mcp-shell/src/project-registry.ts`) instead of
 * inventing a third: validate before touching disk, refuse on a corrupt tail
 * rather than "repairing" it, keep the file 0600 in a directory that is not
 * group/other-writable, fsync, then read back and verify — and never truncate,
 * because the ledger's job is to record what happened, including a failed write.
