"""Backup inspection and restore (``iterate backup``).

The CLI writes a timestamped copy of a file beside itself before every
mutation — ``config set``/``config unset`` (``*.configset-*`` /
``*.configunset-*``), ``doctor --fix`` (``*.doctorfix-*``), ``refresh`` /
``personalize`` / ``onboard`` (``*.refresh-*`` / ``*.personalize-*`` /
``*.onboard-*``), ``import`` (``*.import-*``) and ``reonboard``
(``*.bak-*``). Until now there was **no way to see or restore them**: a user
who needed to undo a bad ``config set`` had to ``ls`` the project directory
and guess which of the ``*.configset-*`` files was the pre-change copy, or
re-run the interactive wizard and hope.

This module closes that gap. ``iterate backup list`` enumerates every
recognisable backup in the project root (newest first, with the original
file, the operation that wrote it, and the UTC timestamp). ``iterate backup
restore FILE`` puts one back: the current file is itself backed up first
(tagged ``restore``) so a restore is reversible, then the backup content is
written to the original path. A restore never touches a file that does not
look like an iterate backup, never leaves the project root, and is refused
when the target is a directory.

The CLI layer (``iterate_cli/cli.py``) handles I/O, prompts and exit codes;
everything here is pure and unit-testable.
