"""Defensive-programming guards and invariants (``iterate guard`` / ``iterate invariant``).

v3.0 defensive-programming mode ships three deterministic checks that a host
assistant can run around every coding step, so that "defensive" is enforced by
the CLI rather than by prompt discipline alone:

- ``iterate guard pre-check [paths...]`` — run BEFORE touching anything: verify
  the target paths exist, the git worktree is clean enough to start, required
  dependency manifests are present, and the configured validation commands are
  still metachar-safe. Exit code 0 = clear to proceed; 1 = do not start.
- ``iterate guard post-check [module...]`` — run AFTER an edit: execute exactly
  the configured ``validation.commands.<module>`` commands (the runtime
  authoritative whitelist) against the changed modules. Exit code 0 = the edit
  is safe; 1 = the edit must be reverted before continuing.
- ``iterate invariant`` — run BEFORE delivering: evaluate the project-level
  invariants declared under ``config.invariants`` (per-module command lists plus
  ``ensure`` file assertions). Exit code 0 = all invariants hold; 1 = at least
  one invariant is violated.

Safety rules carried over from the iterate security baseline:
- Commands are only ever executed when they EXACTLY match a configured
  ``validation.commands`` / ``invariants.commands`` entry (after trim). No
  command is ever composed, prefixed, or parameterised here.
- Fail-closed metachar enforcement: a command containing shell-chaining
  metacharacters (or empty after trim) is REFUSED at execution time — and
  flagged by ``pre-check`` / ``--dry-run`` — so a hand-edited or drift-polluted
  config can never chain extra shell through ``subprocess.run(..., shell=True)``.
- ``--dry-run`` prints the exact commands that WOULD run without executing them
  (fail-fast: unsafe commands are reported as failures, not run).
