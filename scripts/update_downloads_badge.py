"""Fetch cross-platform download counts and write badges/downloads.json.

Aggregates the all-time download counts of the skill from three sources:

* ClawHub     -- https://clawhub.ai/api/skill?slug=iterate-skill
* SkillHub    -- https://api.skillhub.tencent.com/api/v1/skills/iterate-skill
* npm         -- https://api.npmjs.org/downloads/point/<range>/iterate-skill-installer

The resulting `badges/downloads.json` is consumed by the README "Downloads"
badge via shields.io's dynamic/json endpoint.

Only writes the file when a full set of three counts can be resolved. When an
upstream API is unavailable, the previously committed value is reused (with a
warning) so the badge never shows a misleading partial sum.
